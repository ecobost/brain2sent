| test_deconv.h5		| 39 Mb		| Matrix (540 x 8982) called 'responses'. Similar to train_deconv but for BOLD activity during testing.			|

## Image vectors
| 	   Filename			| 	Size	| 				Description				|
|:---------------------:|:---------:|:--------------------------------------|
| train_full_feats.h5	| 332 Mb	| Matrix (108000 x 768) called 'feats'. Each row corresponds to the convnet-generated feature vector for each image in the original stimuli matrix, thus, one vector per video frame.							|
| train_feats.h5		| 22 Mb		| Matrix (7200 x 768) called 'feats'. Each row is the mean feature vector for images spanning one second of video. Obtained by averaging every 15 rows in train_full_feats.								|
| train_conv_feats.h5	| 44 Mb		| Matrix (7200 x 768) called 'feats'. Each row is obtained by convolving the feature vectors in train_full_feats with the canonical (Glover) HRF and subsampling the results (1 every 15 rows).					|
| test_full_feats.h5	| 25 Mb		| Matrix (8100 x 768) called 'feats'. Similar to train_full_feats but for test images.	|
| test_feats.h5			| 2 Mb		| Matrix (540 x 768) called 'feats'. Similar to train_feats but for test images.		|

## Models
xxxx = ['4sec'|'5sec'|'6sec'|'7sec'|'conv'\]'_smooth'? | 'deconv'. For instance,
l2_xxxx.h5 could be 'l2_5sec_smooth.h5'. Models are trained on train_xxxx_bold 
to predict train_feats except for 'conv' (or 'conv_smooth') that are trained on
train_bold (or train_smooth_bold) to predict train_conv_feats.

| f_xxxx.h5		| 55 Mb	| Matrix (768 x 8982) called 'weights' and vector (768) called 'bias', parameters for an l2-regularized multioutput linear regression model (Ridge) trained after selecting features using an F-statistic.				|
| roi_xxxx.h5	| 55 Mb	| Matrix (768 x 8982) called 'weights' and vector (768) called 'bias', parameters for an l2-regularized multioutput linear regression model (Ridge) trained after selecting features based on ROI.						|
