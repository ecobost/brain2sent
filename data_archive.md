## Brain responses
| 	   Filename			| 	Size 	| 				Description				|
|:---------------------:|:---------:|:--------------------------------------|
| train_bold.h5			| 259 Mb	| Matrix (7200 x 8982) called 'responses'. BOLD responses (already deconvolved) to training stimuli (timesteps x voxels, Subject 1). Valid voxels are extracted using the provided ROI masks (9137 voxels out of 73728; all regions are used). Voxels with nan values are dropped (155).	|
| roi_info.h5			| 74 Kb		| Vector (8982) called 'rois'. ROI ID for each voxel in train_bold (see section ROI below for ID assignments).	|
| train_smooth_bold.h5	| 259 Mb	| Matrix (7200 x 8982) called 'responses'. Temporally smoothed BOLD responses. Generated by applying a Gaussian filter (with sigma=5 seconds) to each voxel/column in train_bold.								|
| test_bold.h5			| 19 Mb		| Matrix (540 x 8982) called 'test_responses'. Similar to train_bold but for test stimuli.						|
| test_smooth_bold.h5	| 19 Mb		| Matrix (540 x 8982) called 'test_responses'. Similar to train_smooth_bold but generated from test_bold.		|

## Image vectors
| 	   Filename			| 	Size	| 				Description				|
|:---------------------:|:---------:|:--------------------------------------|
| train_full_feats.h5	| 332 Mb	| Matrix (108000 x 768) called 'feats'. Each row corresponds to the convnet-generated feature vector for each image in the original stimuli matrix, thus, one vector per video frame.							|
| train_feats.h5		| 22 Mb		| Matrix (7200 x 768) called 'feats'. Each row is the feature vector for the image the subject was seeing at that timepoint. Obtained by subsampling 1 every 15 rows of train_full_feats.							|
| train_1sec_feats.h5	| 22 Mb		| Matrix (7200 x 768) called 'feats'. Each row is the mean feature vector for images spanning one second of video. Obtained by averaging every 15 rows in train_full_feats.								|
| test_full_feats.h5	| 25 Mb		| Matrix (8100 x 768) called 'test_feats'. Similar to train_full_feats but for test images.	|
| test_feats.h5			| 2 Mb		| Matrix (540 x 768) called 'test_feats'. Similar to train_feats but for test images.		|
| test_1sec_feats.h5	| 2 Mb		| Matrix (540 x 768) called 'test_feats'. Similar to train_1sec_feats but for test images.	|

## Models
| 	   Filename			| 	Size	| 				Description				|
|:---------------------:|:---------:|:--------------------------------------|
| model_a.h5			| -			| Matrix (768 x 8982) called 'weights' and a vector (768) called 'bias', the weights and bias for an l1-regularized multiple linear regression model (Lasso) trained on train_bold_4s_delay to predict train_feats.		|
| model_p.h5			| -			| Matrix (400 x 8982) called 'weights_ih' and a vector (400) called 'bias_ih' that map input to hidden layer activations and a matrix (768 x 400) called 'weights_ho'and a vector (768) called 'bias_ho' that map hidden layer activations to output. Trained on train_bold_4s_delay to predict train_feats.		|

## Image vector predictions from best model
| 	   Filename			| 	Size 	| 				Description				|
|:---------------------:|:---------:|:--------------------------------------|
| train_preds_x.h5		| -			| Matrix (7200 x 768) called 'preds'. Each row is the image vector predicted by model_x (the best model) for each training sample.	|
| test_preds_x.h5		| -			| Matrix (540 x 768) called 'test_preds'. Similar to train_preds_x but for test samples.											|

## Sentence predictions (used only for qualitative comparisons, not training/cv)
| 	   Filename			| 	Size 	| 				Description				|
|:---------------------:|:---------:|:--------------------------------------|
| train_sents_gt.txt	| -			| Text file (7200 lines). Each line is the ground truth sentence prediction made by neuralTalk for each image in the training set (generated from train_feats).												|
| train_sents_x.txt		| -			| Text file (7200 lines). Each line is the sentence prediction for image vectors predicted by model_x (the best model) in the training set (generated from train_preds_x).								|
| test_sents_gt.txt		| -			| Text file (540 lines). Similar to train_sents_gt but for the test set (generated from test_feats).	|
| test_sents_x.txt		| -			| Text file (540 lines). Similar to train_sents_x but for the test set (generated from test_preds_x).	|
